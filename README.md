381assignment1

There are two sets of instructions below: one for those who were able to do just the minimal software install (R, Rstudio, tidyverse), and a second set for those who were able to install all of the software (R, Rstudio, tidyverse, rmarkdown, tinytex, git.)
Minimal instalation

The following instructions assume that:

    you have a minimal installation of R, Rstudio, and the tidyverse, as described here: https://github.com/rpmartin/Rinstall

    I have uploaded the data and the .R and .docx files (you should see them listed above)

Steps:

Click on the green button labeled code.

Click on download zip file.

Unzip the downloaded file somewhere you can find it.

open Rstudio.

click on File in the top menu bar, then New Project, then Existing Directory, then choose the unzipped directory.

Open file assignment1.R

Ensure that your cursor is at the top of the file assignment1.R (the file is open in the top-left box in Rstudio). Run the code by repeatedly hitting both control and enter. By doing so you step through the code line by line, and in the bottom left panel you see the results of each line of code. The last line of code creates your first graph, which should show up in the bottom right panel.

There should be no errors (yet ;) when you run the code of assignment1.R. If there are errors, do not proceed further! Get in touch either by email or on the message board.

Open assignment1.docx

Enter your name and student ID at the top, and “sign” your academic integrity statement (replace name here with your name).

Insert file first_plot.jpeg where it says [insert first_plot.jpeg here]

Continue to add prose and plots to assignment1.docx
Full software instalation

The following instructions assume that

    you have installed and tested R, Rstudio, tidyverse, Rmarkdown and tinytex, as described here: https://github.com/rpmartin/Rinstall

    I have uploaded the data and the .R and .Rmd files (you should see them listed above)

Steps:

The following instructions assume that

    You have installed and tested R, Rstudio, tidyverse, Rmarkdown and tinytex, as described here: https://github.com/rpmartin/Rinstall
    I have uploaded the data and the .R and .Rmd files (you should see them listed above)

Here is how you get started on assignment 1.

                            a577a3ce8cbb8b1412a4244cb498c07de1e53c9d

    go to https://github.com/rpmartin/381assignment1

    click on the green button labeled code.

    click on the clipboard icon to copy address to clipboard (the icon is to the right of the text box.)

    open Rstudio.

    click on File in the top menu bar, then New Project, then Version Control, then Git.

    Where it asks for Repository URL paste (control V) from your clipboard (this should be what you copied from step 3)

    R chooses the name of the folder in which you will be working, but you should choose where you want this folder saved.

    Click Create Project and Rstudio will start in this folder, and all the files you need have been cloned into this folder from github.

    Open file assignment1.R

    Ensure that your cursor is at the top of the file assignment1.R (the file is open in the top-left box in Rstudio). Run the code by repeatedly hitting both control and enter. By doing so you step through the code line by line, and in the bottom left panel you see the results of each line of code. The last line of code creates your first graph, which should show up in the bottom right panel.

    There should be no errors (yet ;) when you run the code of assignment1.R. If there are errors, do not proceed further! Get in touch either by email or on the message board. Only once you have checked that there are no errors in your assignment1.R file should you open up assignment1.Rmd file.

    In the assignment1.Rmd file enter your name and student ID at the top, and "sign" your academic integrity statement (replace name here with your name).

    Knit your assignment1.Rmd file by hitting the knit button (there is a ball of yarn with a needle sticking out of it beside the word knit). This is called knitting because we are "weaving" together R code (that produces graphs and tables) and prose.

    A new window should open with your assignment... you are on your way!

    For written answers, simply write words under the questions in the assignment1.Rmd file.

    For graphs, you create and name the graph in your assignment1.R file. Check frequently to make sure your assignment1.R file still runs without errors. Only once you have made sure there are no errrors in assignment1.R save it to DISK. (your Rmd file can't utilize what isn't saved to disk e.g. the unsaved code in your editor or even objects in your current environment.)

    Embed the objects in the assignment1.Rmd file by name, and knit to see the results.

Let me know if you have any issues, I am here to help! Cheers,
